# ID-Assignment1 - Chinese orchestra website

This is a project for ID-Assignment1, and what i did is a webiste for The Chinese Orchestra(TCO) TCO is
a virtual or inexistent orchestra that i create for this assignment. 
This website is create for TCO for the events that TCO going to conduct like the year end performance. And also shows the members, instruments TCO have, a form use to join TC and also TCO's history even though all the members are generate by AI.And at the same time also hope to tell people mroe about chinese orchestra.

 
## Design Process
 This website is use to let eveyone know about TCO and more knowledge about chinese orchestra like its history or its instruments. I have add in many virtual things like what are the events the TCO going to conduct, most of the event is use my own experience and what i know to write.
 I also add in many instruments picture and some of their information inside but this is still not complete
because there are too many traditional instruments  for example just sheng itself have have many types so i may edit the rest in the future
For the member page, inorder to make this website like real i think a member is necessary so i use random face generator and random name generator to generate some picture and a name and at same time i give all of them a story about their past to make the website more realistic
And the join us and feedback survey is also something I think as a orchestra website or as a website is needed so ai add both inside this assignment.
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows all users to vist all the pages(home page, instrument page, member page, histroy page) in TCO website
- Feature 2 - allows all users to be able to use the join us to feel in the join use form
- Feature 3 - allows all users to use and take the feedback survey form

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used
-[ visual stuido code](link:https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - for coding the html,css and javascript i use visual studio code
-[ adobe XD](link:https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/xd.html)
    - which i feel that it is very useful for creating framework

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail asis relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
