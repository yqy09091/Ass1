# ID-Assignment1 - Chinese orchestra website

This is a project for ID-Assignment1, and what i did is a webiste for The Chinese Orchestra(TCO) TCO is
a virtual or inexistent orchestra that i create for this assignment. 
This website is create for TCO for the events that TCO going to conduct like the year end performance. And also shows the members, instruments TCO have, a form use to join TC and also TCO's history even though all the members are generate by AI.And at the same time also hope to tell people mroe about chinese orchestra.
# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VEWING MY WEBSITE
    My laptop default display setting for Scale and Layout is 125%, Display resolution is 1920 *1080
    so my website is best match with this setting, if open my website in other setting like 150% parts of the website will be messy. You can click the right click of the mouse -> Display settings to set your display setting
    For responsive my website has develop responsive for iPhone SE
## Design Process
 This website is use to let eveyone know about TCO and more knowledge about chinese orchestra like its history or its instruments. I have add in many virtual things like what are the events the TCO going to conduct, most of the event is use my own experience and what i know to write.
 I also add in many instruments picture and some of their information inside but this is still not complete
because there are too many traditional instruments  for example just sheng itself have have many types so I may edit the rest in the future
For the member page, inorder to make this website like real I think a member is necessary so I use random face generator and random name generator to generate some picture and a name and at same time I give all of them a story about their past to make the website more realistic
And the join us and feedback survey is also something I think as a orchestra website or as a website is needed so ai add both inside this assignment.
