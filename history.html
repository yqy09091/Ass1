        <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">The term Chinese orchestra is most commonly used to refer to the modern Chinese orchestra that is found in China and various overseas Chinese communities. This modern Chinese orchestra first developed out of Jiangnan sizhu ensemble in the 1920s into a form that is based on the structure and principles of a Western symphony orchestra but using Chinese instruments.</p>
            <br><div style="height: 10px;">
        </div><p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em"> The orchestra is divided into four sections – wind, plucked strings, bow strings, and percussion, and usually performs modernized traditional music called guoyue. The orchestra may be referred to as Minzu Yuetuan (Chinese: 民族乐团) or Minyuetuan (Chinese: 民乐团) in mainland China, Chung Ngok Tuen (Chinese: 中樂團) in Hong Kong, Huayuetuan (Chinese: 华乐团) in Southeast Asia, or Guoyuetuan (Chinese: 國樂團; lit. 'national orchestra') in Taiwan, all meaning Chinese orchestra.</p>
            <br><div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">The term modern Chinese orchestra is sometimes used to distinguish the current form from ancient Chinese orchestras that existed since the Shang dynasty and was used in royal courts and later during Confucian ceremonies.</p>
            <br><div style="height: 10px;"></div>
            <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">Archaeological findings suggest that ancient China has a highly developed and sophisticated music culture. Music was an important element in traditional ritualistic ceremonies during the Shang dynasty (c. 1550-1111 BC), and it reached one of its peaks during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1111–222 BC). The ancient orchestra of the Zhou dynasty played a form of ceremonial music known as yayue.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">It featured a great abundance of percussion instruments. There were also several wind instruments, but only a few zither-type string instruments were used. All the bowed string instruments and many plucked string instruments first came to China from Central Asia after the Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 219).</p>
            
            <br><div style="height: 10px;"></div>
            <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">The Six Dynasties era following the collapse of the Han dynasty saw a wave of musical influence from Central Asia, and Central Asian Music became very popular during the Sui-Tang dynasty period. The Tang period was a very important epoch in the evolution of Chinese music, and court banquet music called yanyue (燕樂) was the dominant form of music during this era. The number of orchestras in the Tang court may reach ten, each playing a different form of music including yanyue, qingyue, and music of other places such as Kucha, Kashgar, Samarkand, Korea and India. The Tang imperial court also had a large outdoor band of nearly 1,200 performers. Chinese music then continued to evolve during the Song dynasty (AD 960–1279) with major development in yayue, and a yayue orchestra in this period may have over 200 instrumentalists.</p>
            
            <br><div style="height: 10px;"></div>
            <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">Aside from the orchestras found in the court, musical ensembles, for example those in the sizhu and nanguan tradition, were also found among the general population to provide popular entertainment, and religious groupings may perform music in festivals and other religious settings.</p>
            
            <br><div style="height: 10px;"></div>
            <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 62em">Traditional Chinese musical instruments were classified into eight groups (bayin) according to their materials: gourd, earthenware, hide, wood, stone, bronze, silk and bamboo. It is said that there were more than 70 different musical instruments, but many of them have been lost or are obsolete today.</p>
